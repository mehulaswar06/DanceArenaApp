# नृत्यांगना - The Dance Arena 


<b> Problem Statement: </b>

India’s classical dance forms were thought to be evergreen throughout the existence of the universe. It was said to be such a blessing if you were born with that talent to grasp the godly essence of the art itself and become a part of it. It was not just an art form back then. It was the rhythm of nature. It was an essence of God. It was a speck of spirituality. Indeed; today it's all different.The art forms are fading away when generations progresses. When the promoters are less and so are the people who are actually interested in this stuff. The so called ‘broader mindset’ of the newer generation is all about modern culture and western ways. So most prefer hip hop, freestyle and contemporary over classical dances. As mentioned earlier, teachers who promote to the core of the art are countable as of today, hence most don't get the idea of what this is all about.        Indian Classical Dance and Music should be a part of our school-activities. This Art is not only the quintessence of Sweetness, Beauty and Power of our eternal Culture, but it is also a prayer and meditation, attracting divine blessings, happiness and peace of mind. The app is an effort to narrow down the knowledge gap we observed in young minds.

<b> Proposed Solution : </b>

नृत्यांगना - The Dance Arena is an initiative to preserve the Indian culture and history by bringing awareness among the young generation about the classical Dance forms. Dance and Music play a very important role. They soothe and relax the minds of over-stressed school-children and at the same time they educate the children and stimulate their concentration and creativity. Cultural education also promotes further interest and helps discover talents among students. Thus some students may find their vocation in Indian Classical Dance and Music. If one wants to learn this important part of our Vedic culture one comes across countless disciplines, which enrich and refine the human personality and make it more and more divine. But, as we know the school education is focused only on getting good grades and not on imparting knowledge about cultural heritage and mythological instances. We are proposing नृत्यांगना - The Dance Arena to enlighten the society about the diminishing forms of Indian Classical Dance.

<b> Functionality & Concepts used : </b>

 The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps the user to navigate the app easily and explore the different Indian Classical Dance Forms while elaborating the common aspects involved in every dance form. Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app :
 
 - Navigation Component: To help you handle any navigation implementation, simple or complex, in your app. The Navigation component has three key parts which we used to implement navigation in the our app.
 - Simple & Easy Views Design : Use of simple UI and interactive cards makes user experience seamless while navigating through the app using JetPack Navigation Component.
- RecyclerView : To present the list of different dance forms we used the efficient recyclerview.
- Room Database : We are also using Room Database to store the data of the app.
- View Model: To save the app's transient data and to also access the database, you need a ViewModel.The ViewModel class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.ViewModel will interact with the database via the DAO, and provide data to the UI. We fetched the data in our app from the database using coroutines and viewModelScope.

<b> Application Link & Future Scope : </b>

In the near future, you will be seeing a streak feature wherein each streak (like Duolingo) will represent a step-by-step ladder containing elements to help you know your interest towards a specific dance form and guide you to achieve basic understanding about the dance form. This will result in achieving the basic certification. 

Furthermore, after the basic certification you will be encouraged for the next step in learning the nitty gritties of the chosen dance form.
